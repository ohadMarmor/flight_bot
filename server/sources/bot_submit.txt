ACCORDING THIS DATA, CREATE THE MOST ACCURATE SUGGESTION YOU CAN FOR A FLIGHT IN THIS FORMAT AND IN THIS ORDER:

DESTINATION:SUGGESTED_DESTINATION(ONE OPTION ONLY, EVEN IF THE LIST HAS MORE TAKE THE MOST LIKELY ONE. IT COULD BE THE ONE THAT OCCURS MORE THAN THE OTHER
OR THE ONE THAT OCCURS MAINLY IN THE END OF THE LIST, OR THE MOST SPECIFIC ONE LIKE CITY AND NOT COUNTRY... BUT IT'S UP TO YOU TO CHOOSE, BUT IT MUST BE A DEFINED DESTINATION AND NOT A DESCRIPTION OF DESTINATION),
SPORTS:SUGGESTED_SPORTS(ONE OPTION ONLY ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES OR A ONE THAT OCCURS MAINLY IN THE END OF THE LIST),ACTIVITIES:SUGGESTED_ACTIVITIES(ONE OPTION ONLY ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES OR A ONE THAT OCCURS MAINLY IN THE END OF THE LIST), TEAMS: SUGGESTED_TEAMS(ONE OPTION ONLY ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES OR A ONE THAT OCCURS MAINLY IN THE END OF THE LIST)
}
