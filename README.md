## Description
This project combines JavaScript, React, and Flask to create a chatbot that engages users in conversations about their preferences, favorite sports teams, vacation styles, and food choices. By leveraging the OpenAI API as the chatbot engine, this application ensures context-appropriate responses and a seamless user experience.

Upon registration and sign-in, users gain access to a side toolbar where they can view and manage their previous conversations. Within each conversation, users discuss their interests with the chatbot, which then suggests destinations based on the conversation's content. At the end of a conversation, the chatbot provides links to flights for the chosen destination and a list of events happening in that area during specific dates.

The Flights Chatbot for Sports Fans also includes a user-based recommender system that takes into account past conversations. By utilizing various technologies such as ML models from NLTK, Selenium for web scraping, regular expressions, and the Jellyfish library for distance metric comparisons, the recommender system suggests destinations based on preferences of similar users.
